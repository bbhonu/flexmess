		<h2>A Dangerous Trend</h2>
		<p>Those who have been diagnosed know how much it is trivialized by restaurants and the media due to the spike in the trendiness of a gluten-free diet.</p>  <p>This has lead to a reduction in the safety of eating out because it isn’t taken as seriously. But celiac disease is not a joke for the 1% of the population that it does affect. </p>
		<figure><img src=img/graph.png alt="graph"><figcaption>This graph from the Journal of Pediatric medicine shows the rise of the gluten free trend and how it has no significant effect on bringing about Celiac awareness.</figcaption></figure>

		<h2>What is Celiac Disease?</h2>
		<p>It’s not an allergy or an intolerance.</p>

<p>Celiac is a hereditary autoimmune disease. When gluten is consumed by someone with Celiac, their immune system attacks the part of the body where nutrients are absorbed. </p> 
<p>This inflammatory response causes severe GI pain and can lead to and various issues like malnourishment, dermatitis herpetiformis, lymphoma, anemia, depression, liver disease, and osteopenia (weak bones).

		<h2>What is gluten?</h2>
		<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat (including wheatberries, durum, emmer, semolina, spelt, farina, farro, and graham), barley, and rye.</p>

		<h2>Gluten is Good</h2>
		<h3 class="most"> (for most people)</h3>
		<p>So are those who say that they’re “gluten intolerant” faking it?
Not necessarily.</p><p>They probably fall into one of several groups:</p> 
<ul>
<li>- Celiac hasn’t fully developed yet so they can’t be properly diagnosed. </li>
<li>- They have a wheat allergy (there is no such thing as a gluten allergy.)</li>
<li>- They are sensitive to FODMAPs, a type of carbohydrate that includes wheat.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3 class= "please">So please, <br>eat it if you can.</h3>
<p class="242">
A gluten-free diet is no way to lose weight, and gluten-free foods are 242% more expensive than their gluten containing counterparts.</p>
